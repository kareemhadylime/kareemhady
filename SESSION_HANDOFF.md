# Kareemhady — Session Handoff (2026-04-27)

## 🟢 Latest turn — Phase J.1 → J.4 shipped (commits `0346db5`, `90ae39e`, `1e6bde0`, `40958cc`)

J.4 — 10-tab reservation drawer (`40958cc`):
- [src/lib/beithady/operations/reservation-detail.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/reservation-detail.ts) — `getReservationDetail(id)` parallel-fetches base + conversation + last 10 messages + tasks + upsells + audit + ads attribution + lead pipeline + past stays + reviews
- [drawer.tsx](src/app/emails/beithady/operations/calendar/_components/drawer.tsx) — slideover with backdrop, header (confirmation code, guest, listing, status pill, risk pill), tier-specific loyalty banner (VIP/Platinum/Gold/Silver perks), 10 tabs in a left rail
- All 10 tabs implemented in V1 (read-only): Overview / Guest / Channel / Payment / Communication / Check-in / Tasks / Upsells / Attribution / Audit
- Past-stay quick-look (improvement #12) shows last 3 stays with star ratings + previous review excerpts
- Loyalty banner (improvement #13) drives feature gating per tier
- Page parallel-fetches grid data + reservation detail; drawer mounts when `?reservation=<id>` is set
- Read-only V1; write actions (mark paid, status changes, manual blocks) land in J.7

J.3 — Read-only Calendar Grid (`1e6bde0`):
- [src/lib/beithady/operations/calendar-data.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/calendar-data.ts) + [channel-meta.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/channel-meta.ts) + [types.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/types.ts)
- 5 UI components: anomaly-banner, header-bar (filters + URL params), listing-rail, reservation-bar, calendar-grid (220px sticky rail × N date cols, today indicator, weekend tinting)
- Click reservation → `?reservation=<id>` (drawer wired in J.4)

**Phase J progress:** J.1 ✅ J.2 ✅ J.3 ✅ J.4 ⏳ (build verification pending) — J.5–J.10 ⏳

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Phase J.1 + J.2 + J.3 shipped

J.3 grid coding done — Vercel build verification scheduled. Note on J.1's individual deploy: it errored because adding `operations` to `BeithadyCategory` broke `Record<BeithadyCategory, LauncherTile>` in the launcher map; J.2 fixed it within the same logical change. Canonical `limeinc.vercel.app` is on J.2's READY build (which contains J.1 code).

**J.3 — Read-only Calendar Grid (`1e6bde0`):**

Page at `/emails/beithady/operations/calendar` — server component reading URL params (`from`, `days`, `buildings`, `channels`, `status`, `risk`, `q`).

Library:
- [src/lib/beithady/operations/types.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/types.ts) — `CalendarRow`, `CalendarReservation`, `AnomalySnapshot`, `CalendarFilters`, `CalendarGridData`
- [src/lib/beithady/operations/channel-meta.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/channel-meta.ts) — channel display map (Airbnb red, Booking blue, Direct teal, …) + 3-char short codes
- [src/lib/beithady/operations/calendar-data.ts](src/lib/beithady/operations/calendar-data.ts) — `getCalendarGridData`:
  - Bookable atoms via `fetchMtlParentIds + isBookableAtom` + drops listings without `building_code`
  - Latest `pricelabs_listing_snapshots.recommended_base_price` per listing as cell price
  - Cover thumbnails from `beithady_gallery_assets` (best-effort)
  - Reservations from `beithady_reservation_grid_v` with all filters SQL-side, search post-fetch
  - Status dot per row from next reservation in <14d (red unpaid+≤7d, yellow prearrival missing+≤2d, purple VIP/Gold/Platinum, gray no upcoming, green healthy)

UI components under `_components/`:
- `anomaly-banner.tsx` — top-of-page strip listing flag counts
- `header-bar.tsx` — date nav + view-span (7/14/28) + filters + search
- `listing-rail.tsx` — left rail per row: status dot + cover + nickname + building badge + per-night price
- `reservation-bar.tsx` — colored absolute-positioned bar overlay; click → `?reservation=<id>`. Inquiry → diagonal stripes; cancelled → faded crosshatch; out-of-window → marker stripe
- `calendar-grid.tsx` — 220px sticky-left rail + N date columns (64px). Sticky-top header with day/dow + weekend tinting + amber today column. Pink today vertical line.

Click on a bar sets `?reservation=<id>` URL param; the **drawer slot is empty in J.3** — the 10-tab drawer ships in J.4.

**Phase J progress:** J.1 ✅ J.2 ✅ J.3 ⏳ (build verification pending) — J.4-J.10 ⏳

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Phase J.1 + J.2 shipped

User signed off on the workflow phase. Pre-flight read-only investigations + J.1 (foundation) + J.2 (launcher) all deployed to limeinc.vercel.app via auto-deploy.

**Pre-flight findings (shaped J.1):**
1. `pricelabs_listing_snapshots` has `recommended_base_price` per-listing per-snapshot — no per-night calendar exists. Cells in J.3 use this as a flat per-listing price.
2. `beithady_boarding_passes` has only `viewed_at`/`view_count`/`token` — no ID upload + no smart-lock. V1 risk score drops those components; J.4 Tab 6 ships boarding pass + pre-arrival only.
3. `guesty_reservations.raw.money` carries `hostPayout` / `fareAccommodation` / `commission` / `currency` — used as money source-of-truth.
4. `comp_median_usd` is in `pricelabs_market_snapshots` per (building, bedroom_bucket) — joined in code, not in the view.
5. `beithady_role_permissions` table doesn't exist — permission matrix is in code at `src/lib/beithady/auth.ts`.
6. Status set in `guesty_reservations`: `confirmed` / `inquiry` / `canceled`. Channels: `airbnb2` / `bookingCom` / `hopper` / `manual`.
7. Stripe lib at `src/lib/stripe.ts`, env var `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` confirmed (Phase 5.8).

**J.1 — Foundation (`0346db5`):**
- Migration `0043_beithady_operations.sql` applied via MCP. Tables: `beithady_reservation_overrides` (risk + payment cache + manual fields), `beithady_calendar_saved_views`, `beithady_calendar_manual_blocks`. Views: `beithady_reservation_grid_v` (joins reservations + listings + guests + overrides + boarding pass + pre-arrival), `beithady_calendar_anomalies_v` (banner counts).
- RPCs: `beithady_calendar_recompute_payment(id)`, `beithady_calendar_recompute_risk(id)`, `beithady_calendar_recompute_all_active()` (cron entry point).
- Initial backfill on **277 reservations**: 25 unpaid flag, 23 prearrival missing.
- Permission matrix updated: `operations` BeithadyCategory added to `src/lib/beithady/auth.ts`. Grants: admin/manager/ops = full, GR/finance = read.

**J.2 — Launcher (`90ae39e`):**
- 8th tile "Operations" added to Beithady main launcher (CalendarRange icon, cyan accent).
- Sub-landing at `/emails/beithady/operations`: anomaly snapshot strip + 3 cards (Multi-Calendar, Tasks → Phase F, Boarding Passes).
- `/operations/calendar` placeholder (J.3 lands the grid).
- `/operations/boarding-passes` table of 50 most recent passes from `beithady_boarding_passes`.

**Phase J progress:** J.1 ✅ J.2 ✅ J.3-J.10 ⏳

Next sub-phase J.3 (read-only calendar grid with virtualized rows × dates, ~2 commits) is a natural checkpoint — pausing for user to verify J.1 + J.2 deploys before continuing.

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Phase J workflow drafted (commit `f0a34b9`)

User answered all 10 open questions and confirmed all 12 suggested improvements + added a 13th (loyalty pill on Overview tab driving feature gating per tier). Workflow phase sent for review:

**Scope locked:**
- Route: `/emails/beithady/operations/calendar` (new "Operations" launcher card on Beithady main)
- Pricelabs as price source (existing data)
- Payment data: Guesty API first → Stripe fallback (Stripe only for non-Airbnb channels)
- Read-write to Guesty with confirm modal warning agents on every destructive action
- Manual blocks sync back to Guesty
- Free channel logo set
- Realtime updates via Supabase Realtime (overbooking guard)
- Desktop V1, mobile V2
- AI risk score in V1, bulk actions in V1

**10 sub-phases (J.1 → J.10), each independently shippable to limeinc.vercel.app:**

| Sub-phase | Scope |
|---|---|
| J.1 | Migration `0043_beithady_operations.sql` — `beithady_reservation_overrides`, `beithady_calendar_saved_views`, view `beithady_reservation_grid_v`, RPCs for risk + payment recompute, permission row `operations.calendar` |
| J.2 | Operations launcher card + sub-landing (Calendar/Tasks/Boarding cards) |
| J.3 | Read-only calendar grid with virtualized rows × dates |
| J.4 | 10-tab reservation drawer (Overview/Guest/Channel/Payment/Comms/Check-in/Tasks/Upsells/Attribution/Audit) |
| J.5 | AI risk score (1-10) + status flag dots + every-30min cron |
| J.6 | Filters → URL params + saved views + anomaly banner + channel-mix sparkline |
| J.7 | Read-write actions to Guesty + Stripe payment resolver + bulk actions + drag-to-create blocks |
| J.8 | Supabase Realtime subscription + overbooking pre-write guard |
| J.9 | Heatmap overlay toggle + comp-set price triangles + WhatsApp share-boarding-pass + free channel logos |
| J.10 | Find-availability modal + direct-booking flow |

**Pre-flight read-only investigations** (first commit in coding phase, before J.1 migration):
1. Verify pricelabs table schema for prices/min-stay/comp-set
2. Inspect `guesty_reservations.raw` for payment fields
3. Confirm Phase F check-in + ID upload + boarding pass table names
4. Confirm Stripe env var (Phase 5.8 used `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`)
5. Inspect `guesty_reviews` shape for past-stay quick-look

**Confidence:** ~88% overall (will hit 95% after pre-flight). Highest uncertainty: Guesty write-API surface (J.7), Stripe-Guesty matching heuristic, Phase H/I schema for Attribution tab.

**5 confirmation questions sent to user, blocking coding phase:**
1. OK to ship J.1→J.10 sequentially (each its own Vercel deploy)?
2. OK to run pre-flight read-only investigations as the very first commit?
3. Anything missing in risk register?
4. Reorder anything? (e.g., move realtime/J.8 before J.7?)
5. "Operations" sub-landing with 3 cards — keep, or just put Calendar directly under `/emails/beithady/calendar`?

Estimated ~13 commits across the phase. No code written this turn. Awaiting user answers before queuing pre-flight + J.1.

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Phase J plan accepted (turn before this)

User confirmed all 13 improvements + answered all 10 open questions from the plan-phase. Notable additions:
- **#13 NEW**: Show guest loyalty level on reservation header → drives feature gating (VIP gets X, Gold gets Y, etc.)
- **#12 expanded**: Past-stay quick-look should also surface previous reviews if any
- **Manual blocks (Q5)**: yes, sync back to Guesty
- **Realtime (Q7)**: confirmed — to prevent overbooking
- **Bulk actions (Q10)**: V1 scope

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Phase J initial plan drafted

User asked to plan a Guesty-style multi-calendar reservation module for Beithady. This turn was **plan-only**, per the user's process: "Plan → 95% confidence → Workflow → 95% → Code". No files written.

Reference UX (from screenshots the user shared this turn):
- Multi-row calendar grid: properties × dates with nightly price + min-stay in each cell, reservation bars overlaying date spans, channel-color coding, today indicator.
- Right-slideover reservation drawer: status, channel, guests, listing, check-in/out, nights, rate plan + tabs for guest, payment, communication, etc.

Plan I sent the user (waiting on answers to 10 questions before workflow phase):

**Module:** new "Operations" category card on the Beithady launcher; route `/emails/beithady/operations/calendar`.

**Grid rows = bookable atoms** (children + standalones — uses `fetchMtlParentIds + isBookableAtom` from `src/lib/beithady/mtl.ts`). 74 rows total: BH-73 28, BH-26 22, BH-435 14, BH-OK 10. Cells show price (pricelabs) + min-stay; reservation bars span check-in→check-out, color-coded by channel, click → drawer.

**Drawer = 10 tabs:** Overview / Guest (Phase B link) / Channel & Source / Payment & Finance / Communication (Phase C link + AI Phase E) / Check-in & Boarding (Phase F) / Tasks (Phase F) / Upsells (Phase F) / Attribution (Phases H + I) / Audit log (Phase A).

**Status-flag dot column** in left rail computed from each row's *next* upcoming reservation: red (unpaid + check-in ≤7d), orange (ID missing + ≤3d), yellow (pre-arrival not sent + ≤2d), green (healthy), purple (VIP arriving), gray (no booking in window).

**12 suggested improvements over Guesty** — flagged: AI risk score, heatmap overlay toggle, comp-set price triangles, bulk actions, drag-to-create manual blocks, Supabase Realtime live updates, saved views, anomaly callouts, channel-mix sparkline, WhatsApp share-boarding-pass, past-stay quick-look, mobile-optimized mode.

**Tech architecture sketch:** server component initial fetch + virtualized client grid + drawer via `?reservation=<id>` URL param + server actions for mutations. New tables: 1 (`beithady_reservation_overrides` for manual blocks/cache).

**10 open questions** asked the user, blocking workflow phase: routing placement, pricelabs DB schema, payment data source (Guesty vs Stripe), read-only vs read-write to Guesty, manual block sync semantics, channel logo assets, Realtime vs polling, mobile scope, AI risk score in v1 vs v2, bulk actions in v1 vs v2.

Confidence: ~85% on structure + grid + drawer 1–7; ~70% on payment/attribution/write-back depth pending user's answers.

## 🟢 Earlier this session — MTL polarity unified across Beithady (commit `5256135`)

User confirmed Option B (data-side fix). Three pieces:

**1. Migration `0042_beithady_mtl_backfill.sql`** — Adds `beithady_backfill_mtl_master_id()` RPC that infers `master_listing_id` from the nickname-prefix convention used in BH-73 (`BH73-3BR-SB-1-201` → child of `BH73-3BR-SB-1`). Idempotent — only writes when the value is NULL, so a real Guesty `masterListingId` always wins. One-shot run populated 23 BH-73 children. BH-26, BH-435, BH-OK unchanged (no MTLs).

Result per building:

| | standalones | parents | children |
|---|---|---|---|
| BH-26 | 22 | 0 | 0 |
| BH-73 | 5 | 8 | 23 |
| BH-435 | 14 | 0 | 0 |
| BH-OK | 10 | 0 | 0 |

**2. Sync re-runs the RPC** ([src/lib/run-guesty-sync.ts:233](src/lib/run-guesty-sync.ts:233)) — after every listings upsert. Keeps inference current as Guesty data evolves.

**3. Domain consumers simplified** to one-line SQL filters per the polarity matrix:

| Use | Filter | Polarity |
|---|---|---|
| Gallery / Documents / Ads creative / Pre-arrival | `WHERE master_listing_id IS NULL` | parents + standalones |
| CRM / Communication / Calendar / Daily report / Pipeline | drop parents (use `fetchMtlParentIds`) | children + standalones |

Centralized helpers live in new file [src/lib/beithady/mtl.ts](src/lib/beithady/mtl.ts): `MTL_AGGREGATES_FILTER` constant, `fetchMtlParentIds()`, and `isBookableAtom()`. Polarity matrix documented inline.

Updated this turn:
- [gallery-list.ts](src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts) — removed the `dropMtlChildren` JS helper; gallery uses pure SQL filter. BH-73 → 13 folders.
- [market/calendar.ts](src/lib/beithady/market/calendar.ts) — switched to `fetchMtlParentIds + isBookableAtom`. Drops the `.or('listing_type.is.null,...')` workaround.
- [beithady-daily-report/units.ts](src/lib/beithady-daily-report/units.ts) — `isPhysicalUnit` now consults `master_listing_id` first, fixes a latent bug where BH-73 MTL parents were counted as physical units.

End-to-end sanity check: gallery → BH-26: 22, BH-73: **13**, BH-435: 14, BH-OK: 10. Atoms → BH-26: 22, BH-73: **28**, BH-435: 14, BH-OK: 10.

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Gallery MTL polarity v3 (commit `5abec90`)

User correction: I had the polarity backwards. For the gallery, when an MTL exists, show the **parent** and hide the children. Sub-units share pictures + features with the parent, so a single upload to the MTL covers every child; showing each child as its own folder would force redundant uploads.

Inverted `dropMtlParents` → `dropMtlChildren` in [src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts:127](src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts:127). Same detection mechanism (master_listing_id reverse-ref OR nickname-prefix), opposite kept side.

Counts: BH-26→22 (no MTLs), **BH-73→13** (8 parents + 5 standalones, was 36), BH-435→14, BH-OK→10.

**Open question deferred for next turn:** user asked "use the same rule across all Beithady domain and features whenever fetching from Guesty strictly and writing to database". Gallery is now done. Other Guesty consumers (calendar/CRM/ads/pipeline/communication/daily-report) need per-domain decisions — calendar's occupancy math, for example, wants children (bookable atoms), not parents. Will ask for clarification before scoping a unified policy.

## 🟢 Earlier this turn — Gallery dropped MTL parents (commit `bf53ca1`, superseded)

User pushback after the last commit: BH-73 was still showing 36 folders, not 28. Inspection of the data showed Guesty sync hasn't populated `master_listing_id` yet — the previous turn's filter was effectively a no-op. The MTL hierarchy in BH-73 is encoded entirely in nicknames:

- Parent: `BH73-3BR-SB-1` (an aggregate, not bookable)
- Sub-units: `BH73-3BR-SB-1-001`, `BH73-3BR-SB-1-101`, `BH73-3BR-SB-1-201`, … (`<parent>-NNN`)

Replaced the SQL `master_listing_id IS NULL` filter with a JS post-fetch helper `dropMtlParents()` that drops any row with at least one child, where "child" is detected via either:

- (a) another row's `master_listing_id` points to it (Guesty-structured MTLs — future-proofs)
- (b) another row's nickname starts with `<this.nickname>-` (naming-convention MTLs — today's data)

Both gallery functions in [src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts](src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts) now fetch all matching listings and apply the helper. Counts after fix:

| Building | Before | After | MTL parents dropped |
|---|---|---|---|
| BH-26 | 22 | 22 | 0 |
| BH-73 | 36 | **28** ✓ | 8 |
| BH-435 | 14 | 14 | 0 |
| BH-OK | 10 | 10 | 0 |

The 8 MTL parents dropped from BH-73: `BH73-1BR-C-8`, `BH73-2BR-SB-5`, `BH73-2BR-SB-6`, `BH73-3BR-C-4`, `BH73-3BR-SB-1`, `BH73-3BR-SB-2`, `BH73-3BR-SB-3`, `BH73-ST-C-7`. Page footer text updated to describe the new rule.

## 🟢 Earlier this turn — `master_listing_id IS NULL` filter (commit `f87502f`)

First attempt at the MTL parent/child semantic — switched the SQL filter from `listing_type != 'MTL'` to `master_listing_id IS NULL`. This was the right approach for Guesty-structured MTLs, but turned out to be a no-op against the actual data (sync hasn't populated master_listing_id). Superseded by `bf53ca1` above. Calendar heatmap ([market/calendar.ts:42](src/lib/beithady/market/calendar.ts:42)) was left untouched — it intentionally keeps the opposite semantic for occupancy math.

## 🟢 Earlier this turn — Gallery unit folders fix (commit `4cd4d12`)

User screenshot showed BH-26 building gallery rendering "0 IMPORTED FROM GUESTY" / 0 unit folders even though Guesty has 22 BH-26 listings (BH-26-001…BH-26-501). Investigation: the listings were in `guesty_listings` correctly tagged `building_code = 'BH-26'`, `active = true`, `listing_type = NULL`.

**Root cause:** PostgREST null-comparison gotcha. The Supabase JS query used `.neq('listing_type', 'MTL')`, which translates to SQL `listing_type <> 'MTL'`. In Postgres, `NULL <> 'MTL'` evaluates to **NULL** (not true), so PostgREST drops every row with a null listing_type. Across the 4 active Beithady buildings, 100% of listings have `listing_type = NULL` (BH-26: 22, BH-73: 36, BH-435: 14, BH-OK: 10) → all silently filtered out.

**Fix:** replaced `.neq('listing_type', 'MTL')` with `.or('listing_type.is.null,listing_type.neq.MTL')` in calendar.ts; the gallery-list.ts call sites were superseded by the `master_listing_id` filter above.

Verified post-fix: BH-26 → 22 folders, BH-73 → 36, BH-435 → 14, BH-OK → 10.

## 🟢 Earlier this session — Vercel build hotfix (commit `f478f23`, green on `limeinc.vercel.app`)

The Gallery per-unit-folders commit (`8bd7ca5`) broke production with `Command "npm run build" exited with 1`. Vercel's build logs showed compile ✅ at 30s, then a TypeScript type error during the `tsc` pass:

```
./src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts:215
Type error: Expected 2 arguments, but got 3.
```

Two new call sites in [src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts](src/lib/beithady/gallery/gallery-list.ts) (lines 215 + 257, the per-unit-folder cover and General-Building-Area cover) passed `3600` as a TTL override to `signedUrlFor()`, but the helper's signature only took 2 args.

**Fix:** promoted the TTL to an optional third parameter on `signedUrlFor()` in [src/lib/beithady/gallery/storage.ts:19](src/lib/beithady/gallery/storage.ts:19), default = existing `SIGNED_URL_TTL_SEC = 3600`. Backward-compatible — the 5 other callers (asset-grid, asset-detail-modal, documents/page, ai-label, getSignedUrlForAsset) continue to work unchanged with two args.

Pushed to main. GitHub-triggered build for `f478f23` went green: `dpl_5v3PftwFBByY7pKvtSQFdC9k4XhC` = READY. `limeinc.vercel.app` is unblocked.

16. **MTL semantics v2** (`bf53ca1`) — `dropMtlParents()` via nickname prefix; BH-73 → 28 (kept children — wrong polarity, superseded)
17. **MTL semantics v3** (`5abec90`) — inverted to `dropMtlChildren()`; BH-73 → 13 folders (gallery only)
18. **MTL backfill + cross-domain unification** (`5256135`) — migration 0042 + sync re-runs RPC + central `mtl.ts` helpers + applied to gallery/calendar/daily-report
19. **Phase J plan drafted** (no commit) — Operations Calendar module spec sent; user confirmed 13 improvements + answered 10 questions
20. **Phase J workflow drafted** (no commit) — 10 sub-phase build plan + pre-flight investigations sent for review
21. **Phase J.1 — Operations Calendar foundation** (`0346db5`) — migration 0043, 277 reservations cached with risk + payment status, permission matrix gains `operations` category
22. **Phase J.2 — Operations launcher card + sub-landing** (`90ae39e`) — 8th tile on Beithady main, sub-landing with anomaly snapshot + 3 op cards, calendar placeholder, boarding-passes table
23. **Phase J.3 — Read-only calendar grid** (`1e6bde0`) — server page + `getCalendarGridData` lib + 5 UI components. Click reservation → `?reservation=<id>` (drawer in J.4)
24. **Phase J.4 — 10-tab reservation drawer** (`40958cc`) — `getReservationDetail` lib + 600-line drawer.tsx with all 10 tabs (Overview/Guest/Channel/Payment/Comms/Check-in/Tasks/Upsells/Attribution/Audit) + tier loyalty banner (improvement #13) + past-stay quick-look (improvement #12) (this turn)

User has standing authorization for direct pushes to main ("Always Direct Push") — all phases land on `limeinc.vercel.app` automatically via Vercel's GitHub integration.

## Phase B — CRM read-only (deployed)

**Migrations 0031 + 0032** — beithady_guests + notes + segments + timeline_cache + sync_runs + SQL initial-ingest proc.

**Initial ingest result**: 5,753 guests · 924 returning · 225 platinum auto-VIP · 66 gold · 113 silver · 520 bronze · 253 future arrivals · $10,439,027 lifetime spend.

**CRM library**: loyalty.ts, guests-sync.ts (with fixed fx_rates schema), guest-list.ts, guest-loader.ts, ai-summary.ts, segments.ts.

**Routes**: list page with filters/widgets/CSV export, 360° profile with 7 sub-components, segments CRUD, loyalty (read-only), market-intel/tasks stubs.

**Cron**: `30 5 * * *` UTC daily JS sync.

**Known gap**: `residence_country` is empty for all guests — Phase G enrichment needed.

---

## Phase C.1 — Communication v1 read side (deployed)

**Migrations 0033 + 0034** — beithady_conversations + beithady_messages + comm_sync_runs + ingest/SLA SQL procs.

**Initial ingest**: 6,694 conversations + 1,011 messages mirrored from guesty_*. SLA computed: 2,133 RED breaches, 4 ORANGE.

**Routes under `/emails/beithady/communication`**: landing → /guesty redirect, guesty/wa-cloud/wa-casual/unified tabs, channel-tabs + sla-pill + sidebar-list + thread-pane components.

**Crons**: `*/5 * * * *` comm-sync + sla-recalc.

---

## Phase C.2 — Communication send side (deployed)

**Library**:
- `src/lib/guesty.ts`: `sendGuestyConversationPost()` wraps `POST /v1/communication/conversations/{id}/posts`. Tier-gated; on failure returns `{ ok:false, status, error }` for fallback.
- `src/lib/beithady/communication/send-guesty.ts`: server-side wrapper. Persists outbound, clears SLA, audits.

**Server actions**: `sendGuestyMessageAction` + `toggleKillSwitchAction`.

**UI**: Real reply composer (textarea + char counter + channel chips + send button + inline error/success/AI-off banners + Reply-in-Guesty fallback). "Create booking" deep-link button in thread header.

**Cron**: `0 6,12 * * *` UTC = 09:00 + 15:00 Cairo `late-reply-digest` — generates digest in `beithady_settings`. Phase F adds delivery.

---

## Phase C.3 — WhatsApp Casual two-way (deployed THIS TURN)

**Migration `0035_beithady_wa_casual.sql`** (applied via Supabase MCP):
- Storage bucket `beithady-wa-media` (public, 20MB cap, audio/image/video/pdf MIME allowlist)
- `beithady_green_webhook_events` table — raw event log keyed on `green_event_id` (idempotency unique index)
- `beithady_ensure_wa_casual_conversation(phone_digits, name)` RPC — lazy conv creation on first inbound, links to existing `beithady_guests` by phone_e164

**Green-API client extensions** (`src/lib/whatsapp/green-api.ts`):
- `sendWhatsAppFile` (sendFileByUrl wrapper for voice + media + files)
- `getGreenInstanceState` (online/offline ping)
- `configureGreenInboundWebhook` (one-shot `setSettings` to register webhook URL on Green-API side)

**Inbound webhook** (`/api/webhooks/green/[slug]/route.ts`):
- Obscure-slug protection (matches credentials `webhook_path_slug`)
- Optional `GREEN_API_ALLOWED_IPS` env-var IP allowlist
- GET = health check; POST = ingest event
- Always 200 to Green-API even on internal failure (no retry storms)

**Ingest helper** (`src/lib/beithady/communication/wa-casual-ingest.ts`):
- Handles incomingMessageReceived (text + extendedText + image + doc + video + audio + voice + location + contact)
- Handles outgoingMessageStatus → updates delivery_status on existing message
- Skips group chats (@g.us) for Phase C.3
- Recomputes SLA so the inbox sidebar lights up immediately

**Send wrapper** (`src/lib/beithady/communication/send-wa-casual.ts`):
- `sendWaCasualMessage` (text + optional fileUrl) → Green-API → persists outbound, clears SLA, audits
- `uploadWaMedia` (ArrayBuffer → Supabase Storage → public URL) for voice + attachments

**Server actions** (added to `actions.ts`):
- `sendWaCasualMessageAction` (text-only form action)
- `sendWaCasualVoiceAction` (multipart upload — voice OR file blob; Storage upload then send via Green-API)

**UI**:
- `voice-recorder.tsx` — in-browser MediaRecorder (ogg/opus → webm/opus → mp4 fallback) with start/stop/preview/discard/send + duration display
- `wa-casual-composer.tsx` — text input + voice recorder + file attach + inline error/sent/AI-off banners
- `wa-casual/page.tsx` — replaces stub with functional split-pane inbox. Shows step-by-step setup card when Green-API not yet configured (with the exact webhook URL to register).
- `thread-pane.tsx` — channel-aware composer routing (Guesty → GuestyComposer, wa_casual → WaCasualComposer, wa_cloud → ComposerStub) + Attachments component renders audio/image/file inline with HTML5 audio + thumbnails.

**Live switch** — to activate inbound + outbound (code is ready):
1. Add Green-API credentials in `/admin/integrations` (already used by boat-rental — same provider)
2. Set `webhook_path_slug` to a random string
3. Set webhook URL in Green-API console to `https://limeinc.vercel.app/api/webhooks/green/<slug>`
4. Toggle provider to enabled

## What's deferred

| Slice | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WhatsApp Cloud Beit Hady WABA provisioning + Cloud API send | C.4 | Manual setup task; user provisions then adds creds in `/admin/integrations` for `meta_waba` provider |
| AI auto-reply integration | E | Reads `beithady_settings` keys + per-conv ai_kill_switch from Phase A/C.1 |
| Gallery + Documents | D | Depends on Supabase Storage tier |
| Loyalty editable + Upsell + Pre-arrival + CSAT + Boarding pass + late-reply digest delivery | F | Depends on Phase E |
| Market Intelligence + Calendar Heatmap | G | Depends on `residence_country` enrichment |
| Ads module port | H | Depends on Beithady WABA + Meta Marketing approval |
| Lead pipeline kanban + AI multi-language review reply | I | Cleanup phase |
